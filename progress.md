## 2026-08-31 — Pre-change plan and scope

I am working on the existing frontend dashboard for the Chandrayaan-2 lunar co-registration workflow. This is a frontend-only task; no backend services, APIs, or database work will be added as part of this change.

The goal is to refine the existing single-page mission control experience so it behaves like a smooth lunar exploration dashboard:

1. Keep the dashboard as a mission-control interface, not a generic landing page.
2. Improve crater navigation and interaction smoothing on the Moon viewport.
3. Make crater selection, auto-rotation, and camera transitions feel continuous and intentional.
4. Preserve the scientific telemetry style already present in the UI, while tightening layout responsiveness and interaction reliability.
5. Keep the current mock dataset and visual design, because the real backend is expected to be connected later by teammates.

The work will focus on the current page in the browser rather than creating a new app shell. I will inspect the live behavior, fix real interaction issues, and keep the implementation frontend-only.

Planned implementation areas:
- Moon crater drill-down and click-to-focus workflow
- Scene and target state synchronization
- Ground/surface view interactions for smoother orbiting and motion
- UI polish around the viewport controls and inspector panels
- Build validation after the UI changes

This log will be appended with new progress entries only as work continues.

## 2026-08-31 — Frontend-only implementation and verification

I completed the review of the existing dashboard and validated the current frontend in the browser. The app already had a strong visual concept, but the key interaction issues were the crater navigation flow and the surface-view camera behavior.

The fixes implemented in the current frontend scope were:

- improved crater selection and focus transitions in the Moon viewer,
- tightened the ground/surface pointer interaction so the user can better orbit the crater with mouse movement,
- kept the mission-control layout and scientific telemetry exactly in the intended dashboard direction,
- avoided all backend work and kept the implementation frontend-only, ready for teammate integration later.

Verification evidence:

- `cd "d:\SIH frontend\sih-dashboard" ; npm run build`
- Result: successful production build completed with Vite, exit status successful.

The front end is now aligned with the intended lunar inspection workflow without adding backend or landing-page work.

## 2026-09-01 — Fixed Scene Preset & Pairs Dropdown Stacking Context (Z-Index Clipping)

1. **Root Cause**:
   - The `.panel-card` CSS class has `position: relative; backdrop-filter: blur(20px);`, which creates a local stacking context. Because "L1 PREPROCESSING" was positioned after "SCENE PRESET & PAIRS" in DOM order, its stacking context was rendering on top of the open dropdown menu.
2. **Dynamic Z-Index Elevation & Dismiss Backdrop**:
   - Applied dynamic `zIndex: showSceneDropdown ? 50 : 10` directly to the Scene Preset card, elevating the entire dropdown above all subsequent sidebar cards.
   - Added an invisible click-outside dismiss backdrop (`fixed inset-0 z-40`) to cleanly close the dropdown when clicking anywhere outside.

- `npm run build` in `sih-dashboard` executed cleanly with 0 TypeScript/Vite errors (exit code 0).

## 2026-09-01 — Live Clock Local Time (IST) & Mission UTC Display

1. **Root Cause**:
   - The clock previously called `new Date().toUTCString()` and stripped the `GMT`/`UTC` tag, displaying the raw UTC time (`14:49:02`) without timezone labeling, making it appear as if the clock was behind local time (`20:19 IST`).
2. **Updated Dual Time Representation**:
   - Updated `useMissionClock.ts` to compute both the real-time local time (`20:20:15 IST`) and mission UTC timestamp (`14:50:15 UTC`).
   - Updated `Header.tsx` to clearly display the accurate local time with `IST` indicator and secondary `UTC` mission epoch.
